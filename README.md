## Setup

1. Requirements
    - A VPN account with one of the service providers:
        - Private Internet Access: **username** and **password**
        - Mullvad: user ID ([sign up](https://mullvad.net/en/account/))
        - Windscribe: **username** and **password** | Signup up using my affiliate link below

            [![https://windscribe.com/?affid=mh7nyafu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/master/doc/windscribe.jpg)](https://windscribe.com/?affid=mh7nyafu)

        - Surfshark: **username** and **password**
    - If you have a host or router firewall, please refer [to the firewall documentation](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/doc/firewall.md)

1. On some devices such as Synology or Qnap machines, it's required to setup your tunnel device `/dev/net/tun` on your host:

    ```sh
    insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko
    # or
    modprobe tun
    ```

    You can verify it's here with `ls /dev/net`

1. Launch the container with:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name=pia --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    -e REGION="CA Montreal" -e USER=js89ds7 -e PASSWORD=8fd9s239G \
    qmcgaw/private-internet-access
    ```

    or use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Note that you can:

    - Change the many [environment variables](#environment-variables) available
    - Use `-p 8888:8888/tcp` to access the HTTP web proxy (and put your LAN in `EXTRA_SUBNETS` environment variable, in example `192.168.1.0/24`)
    - Use `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp` to access the SOCKS5 proxy (and put your LAN in `EXTRA_SUBNETS` environment variable, in example `192.168.1.0/24`)
    - Use `-p 8000:8000/tcp` to access the [HTTP control server](#HTTP-control-server) built-in
    - Pass additional arguments to *openvpn* using Docker's command function (commands after the image name)

    **If you encounter an issue with the tun device not being available, see [the FAQ](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/doc/faq.md#how-to-fix-openvpn-failing-to-start)**

1. You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/private-internet-access:latest`. See the [wiki](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/wiki/Common-issues#use-a-release-tag) for more information on other tags available.

## Testing

Check the PIA IP address matches your expectations

```sh
docker run --rm --network=container:pia alpine:3.11 wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io
```

## Connect to it

There are various ways to achieve this, depending on your use case.

- <details><summary>Connect containers in the same docker-compose.yml as PIA</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "service:pia"` to your *docker-compose.yml* (no need for `depends_on`)

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect other containers to PIA</summary><p>

    Add `--network=container:pia` when launching the container, provided PIA is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect containers from another docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "container:pia"` to your *docker-compose.yml*, provided PIA is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in HTTP proxy *Tinyproxy* (i.e. with Chrome, Kodi, etc.)</summary><p>

    You might want to use Shadowsocks instead which tunnels UDP as well as TCP, whereas Tinyproxy only tunnels TCP.

    1. Setup a HTTP proxy client, such as [SwitchyOmega for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en)
    1. Ensure the PIA container is launched with:
        - port `8888` published `-p 8888:8888/tcp`
        - your LAN subnet, i.e. `192.168.1.0/24`, set as `-e EXTRA_SUBNETS=192.168.1.0/24`
    1. With your HTTP proxy client, connect to the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) on port `8888`. You need to enter your credentials if you set them with `TINYPROXY_USER` and `TINYPROXY_PASSWORD`.
    1. If you set `TINYPROXY_LOG` to `Info`, more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in SOCKS5 proxy *Shadowsocks* (per app, system wide, etc.)</summary><p>

    1. Setup a SOCKS5 proxy client, there is a list of [ShadowSocks clients for **all platforms**](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html)
        - **note** some clients do not tunnel UDP so your DNS queries will be done locally and not through PIA and its built in DNS over TLS
        - Clients that support such UDP tunneling are, as far as I know:
            - iOS: Potatso Lite
            - OSX: ShadowsocksX
            - Android: Shadowsocks by Max Lv
    1. Ensure the PIA container is launched with:
        - port `8388` published `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp`
        - your LAN subnet, i.e. `192.168.1.0/24`, set as `-e EXTRA_SUBNETS=192.168.1.0/24`
    1. With your SOCKS5 proxy client
        - Enter the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) as the server IP
        - Enter port TCP (and UDP, if available) `8388` as the server port
        - Use the password you have set with `SHADOWSOCKS_PASSWORD`
        - Choose the encryption method/algorithm to the method you specified in `SHADOWSOCKS_METHOD`
    1. If you set `SHADOWSOCKS_LOG` to `on`, (a lot) more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to PIA</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to PIA,
    publish ports `8000` and `9000` for the PIA container and access them as you would with any other container

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to PIA, all in the same docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to PIA, publish port `8000` and `9000` for the PIA container.
    The docker-compose.yml file would look like:

    ```yml
    version: '3.7'
    services:
      pia:
        image: qmcgaw/private-internet-access
        container_name: pia
        cap_add:
          - NET_ADMIN
        environment:
          - USER=js89ds7
          - PASSWORD=8fd9s239G
        ports:
          - 8000:8000/tcp
          - 9000:9000/tcp
      abc:
        image: abc
        container_name: abc
        network_mode: "service:pia"
      xyz:
        image: xyz
        container_name: xyz
        network_mode: "service:pia"
    ```

    </p></details>

## Private Internet Access port forwarding

Note that [not all regions support port forwarding](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/helpdesk/kb/articles/how-do-i-enable-port-forwarding-on-my-vpn).

When `PORT_FORWARDING=on`, a port will be forwarded on the PIA server side and written to the file specified by `PORT_FORWARDING_STATUS_FILE=/forwarded_port`.

It can be useful to mount this file as a volume to read it from other containers, for example to configure a torrenting client.

## HTTP control server

A built-in HTTP server listens on port `8000` to modify the state of the container. You have the following routes available:

- `http://<your-docker-host-ip>:8000/openvpn/actions/restart` restarts the openvpn process
- `http://<your-docker-host-ip>:8000/unbound/actions/restart` re-downloads the DNS files (crypto and block lists) and restarts the unbound process
