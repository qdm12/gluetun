## Setup

1. Requirements
    - Docker 1.13, in order to have Docker API 1.25 which supports `init` (and, if you use docker-compose, docker-compose version 1.22.0)
    - A Private Internet Access **username** and **password** ([sign up](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/)) or Mullvad user ID ([sign up](https://mullvad.net/en/account/))
    - <details><summary>External firewall requirements, if you have one</summary><p>

        - At start only
            - Allow outbound TCP 443 to github.com
            - If `DOT=on`, allow outbound TCP 853 to allow Unbound to resolve github.com and the PIA subdomain name if you use PIA.
            - If `DOT=off` and `VPNSP=pia`, allow outbound UDP 53 to your DNS provider to resolve the PIA subdomain name.
        - If `VPNSP=pia`, `PIA_ENCRYPTION=strong` and `PROTOCOL=udp`: allow outbound UDP 1197 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `VPNSP=pia`, `PIA_ENCRYPTION=normal` and `PROTOCOL=udp`: allow outbound UDP 1198 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `VPNSP=pia`, `PIA_ENCRYPTION=strong` and `PROTOCOL=tcp`: allow outbound TCP 501 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `VPNSP=pia`, `PIA_ENCRYPTION=normal` and `PROTOCOL=tcp`: allow outbound TCP 502 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `VPNSP=mullvad` and `PORT=`, please refer to the mapping of Mullvad servers in [these source code lines](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/internal/constants/mullvad.go#L64-L667) to find the corresponding UDP port number and IP address(es) of your choice
        - If `VPNSP=mullvad` and `PORT=53`, allow outbound UDP 53 to the corresponding VPN server IPs, which you can fine in [the mapping of Mullvad servers](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/internal/constants/mullvad.go#L64-L667)
        - If `VPNSP=mullvad` and `PORT=80`, allow outbound TCP 80 to the corresponding VPN server IPs, which you can fine in [the mapping of Mullvad servers](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/internal/constants/mullvad.go#L64-L667)
        - If `VPNSP=mullvad` and `PORT=443`, allow outbound TCP 443 to the corresponding VPN server IPs, which you can fine in [the mapping of Mullvad servers](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/internal/constants/mullvad.go#L64-L667)
        - If `VPNSP=windscribe` and `PROTOCOL=udp`: allow outbound UDP 443 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `VPNSP=windscribe` and `PROTOCOL=tcp`: allow outbound TCP 1194 to the corresponding VPN server IPs
        - If `SHADOWSOCKS=on`, allow inbound TCP 8388 and UDP 8388 from your LAN
        - If `TINYPROXY=on`, allow inbound TCP 8888 from your LAN

    </p></details>

1. Launch the container with:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --init --name=pia --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    -e REGION="CA Montreal" -e USER=js89ds7 -e PASSWORD=8fd9s239G \
    qmcgaw/private-internet-access
    ```

    or use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Note that you can:

    - Change the many [environment variables](#environment-variables) available
    - Use `-p 8888:8888/tcp` to access the HTTP web proxy (and put your LAN in `EXTRA_SUBNETS` environment variable)
    - Use `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp` to access the SOCKS5 proxy (and put your LAN in `EXTRA_SUBNETS` environment variable)
    - Pass additional arguments to *openvpn* using Docker's command function (commands after the image name)

1. You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/private-internet-access:latest`. There are also docker tags for older versions available:
    - `qmcgaw/private-internet-access:v2` linked to the [v2 release](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/releases/tag/v2.0) (Golang based, only PIA)
    - `qmcgaw/private-internet-access:v1` linked to the [v1 release](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/releases/tag/v1.0) (shell scripting based, no support, only PIA)
    - `qmcgaw/private-internet-access:old` tag, which is the latest shell scripting version (shell scripting based, no support, only PIA)

## Testing

Check the PIA IP address matches your expectations

```sh
docker run --rm --network=container:pia alpine:3.11 wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io
```

## Connect to it

There are various ways to achieve this, depending on your use case.

- <details><summary>Connect containers in the same docker-compose.yml as PIA</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "service:pia"` to your *docker-compose.yml* (no need for `depends_on`)

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect other containers to PIA</summary><p>

    Add `--network=container:pia` when launching the container, provided PIA is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect containers from another docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "container:pia"` to your *docker-compose.yml*, provided PIA is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in HTTP proxy *Tinyproxy* (i.e. with Chrome, Kodi, etc.)</summary><p>

    You might want to use Shadowsocks instead which tunnels UDP as well as TCP, whereas Tinyproxy only tunnels TCP.

    1. Setup a HTTP proxy client, such as [SwitchyOmega for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en)
    1. Ensure the PIA container is launched with:
        - port `8888` published `-p 8888:8888/tcp`
        - your LAN subnet, i.e. `192.168.1.0/24`, set as `-e EXTRA_SUBNETS=192.168.1.0/24`
    1. With your HTTP proxy client, connect to the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) on port `8888`. You need to enter your credentials if you set them with `TINYPROXY_USER` and `TINYPROXY_PASSWORD`.
    1. If you set `TINYPROXY_LOG` to `Info`, more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in SOCKS5 proxy *Shadowsocks* (per app, system wide, etc.)</summary><p>

    1. Setup a SOCKS5 proxy client, there is a list of [ShadowSocks clients for **all platforms**](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html)
        - **note** some clients do not tunnel UDP so your DNS queries will be done locally and not through PIA and its built in DNS over TLS
        - Clients that support such UDP tunneling are, as far as I know:
            - iOS: Potatso Lite
            - OSX: ShadowsocksX
            - Android: Shadowsocks by Max Lv
    1. Ensure the PIA container is launched with:
        - port `8388` published `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp`
        - your LAN subnet, i.e. `192.168.1.0/24`, set as `-e EXTRA_SUBNETS=192.168.1.0/24`
    1. With your SOCKS5 proxy client
        - Enter the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) as the server IP
        - Enter port TCP (and UDP, if available) `8388` as the server port
        - Use the password you have set with `SHADOWSOCKS_PASSWORD`
        - Choose the encryption method/algorithm `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`
    1. If you set `SHADOWSOCKS_LOG` to `on`, (a lot) more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to PIA</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to PIA,
    publish ports `8000` and `9000` for the PIA container and access them as you would with any other container

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to PIA, all in the same docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to PIA, publish port `8000` and `9000` for the PIA container.
    The docker-compose.yml file would look like:

    ```yml
    version: '3.7'
    services:
      pia:
        image: qmcgaw/private-internet-access
        container_name: pia
        init: true
        cap_add:
          - NET_ADMIN
        environment:
          - USER=js89ds7
          - PASSWORD=8fd9s239G
        ports:
          - 8000:8000/tcp
          - 9000:9000/tcp
      abc:
        image: abc
        container_name: abc
        network_mode: "service:pia"
      xyz:
        image: xyz
        container_name: xyz
        network_mode: "service:pia"
    ```

## Private Internet Access port forwarding

Note that [not all regions support port forwarding](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/helpdesk/kb/articles/how-do-i-enable-port-forwarding-on-my-vpn).

When `PORT_FORWARDING=on`, a port will be forwarded on the PIA server side and written to the file specified by `PORT_FORWARDING_STATUS_FILE=/forwarded_port`.

It can be useful to mount this file as a volume to read it from other containers, for example to configure a torrenting client.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Openvpn disconnects because of a ping timeout</summary><p>

It happens especially on some PIA servers where they change their configuration or the server goes offline.

You will obtain an error similar to:

```s

```

To fix it, you would have to run openvpn with root, by setting the environment variable `OPENVPN_ROOT=yes`.

</p></details>

<details><summary>Private Internet Access: Why do I see openvpn warnings at start?</summary><p>

You might see some warnings similar to:

<details><summary>What files does it download at start before tunneling?</summary><p>

At start, the Go entrypoint only downloads, depending on your settings:

- If `DOT=on`: [DNS over TLS named root](https://github.com/qdm12/files/blob/master/named.root.updated) for Unbound
- If `DOT=on`: [DNS over TLS root key](https://github.com/qdm12/files/blob/master/root.key.updated) for Unbound
- If `BLOCK_MALICIOUS=on`: [Malicious hostnames and IP addresses block lists](https://github.com/qdm12/files) for Unbound
- If `BLOCK_SURVEILLANCE=on`: [Surveillance hostnames and IP addresses block lists](https://github.com/qdm12/files) for Unbound
- If `BLOCK_ADS=on`: [Ads hostnames and IP addresses block lists](https://github.com/qdm12/files) for Unbound

<details><summary>Mullvad does not work with IPv6?</summary><p>

By default, the Mullvad server tunnels both ipv4 and ipv6, hence openvpn will try to create an
ipv6 route. To allow the container to create such route, you have to specify `net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0`
at runtime, using either:

- For a Docker run command, the flag: `--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0`
- In a docker-compose file:

    ```yml
        sysctls:
          - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0
    ```

<details><summary>What's all this Go code?</summary><p>

The Go code is a big rewrite of the previous shell entrypoint, it allows for:

- better testing
- better maintainability
- ease of implementing new features
- faster boot
- asynchronous/parallel operations

It is mostly made of the [internal directory](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/tree/master/internal) and the entry Go file [cmd/main.go](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/cmd/main.go).

<details><summary>How to test DNS over TLS?</summary><p>

- You can test DNSSEC using [internet.nl/connection](https://www.internet.nl/connection/)
- Check DNS leak tests with [https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com)
- Some other DNS leaks tests might not work because of [this](https://github.com/qdm12/cloudflare-dns-server#verify-dns-connection) (*TLDR*: Unbound DNS server is a local caching intermediary)

</p></details>

<details><summary>How to fix OpenVPN failing to start?</summary><p>

You can try:

- Installing the tun kernel module on your host with `insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko` or `modprobe tun`
- Adding `--device=/dev/net/tun` to your docker run command (equivalent for docker-compose, kubernetes, etc.)

## Development

1. Setup your environment

    <details><summary>Using VSCode and Docker</summary><p>

    1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
       - On Windows, share a drive with Docker Desktop and have the project on that partition
       - On OSX, share your project directory with Docker Desktop
    1. With [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), install the [remote containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
    1. In Visual Studio Code, press on `F1` and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
    1. Your dev environment is ready to go!... and it's running in a container :+1:

    </p></details>

    <details><summary>Locally</summary><p>

    Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads); then:

    ```sh
    go mod download
    go get github.com/golang/mock/gomock
    go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen
    ```

    And finally install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#install)

    </p></details>

1. Commands available:

    ```sh
    # Build the entrypoint binary
    go build cmd/main.go
    # Test the entrypoint code
    go test ./...
    # Lint the code
    golangci-lint run
    # Build the Docker image
    docker build -t qmcgaw/private-internet-access .
    ```

1. The Go code is in the Go file [cmd/main.go](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/blob/master/cmd/main.go) and the [internal directory](https://github.com/qdm12/private-internet-access-docker/tree/master/internal), you might want to start reading the main.go file.
