## Setup

1. On some devices you may need to setup your tunnel kernel module on your host with `insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko` or `modprobe tun`
    - [Synology users Wiki page](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/wiki/Synology-setup)
1. Launch the container with:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name gluetun --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    -e VPNSP="private internet access" -e REGION="CA Montreal" \
    -e USER=js89ds7 -e PASSWORD=8fd9s239G \
    -v /yourpath:/gluetun \
    qmcgaw/private-internet-access
    ```

    or use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Note that you can:

    - Change the many [environment variables](#environment-variables) available
    - Use `-p 8888:8888/tcp` to access the HTTP web proxy
    - Use `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp` to access the Shadowsocks proxy
    - Use `-p 8000:8000/tcp` to access the [HTTP control server](#HTTP-control-server) built-in

    **If you encounter an issue with the tun device not being available, see [the FAQ](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/blob/master/doc/faq.md#how-to-fix-openvpn-failing-to-start)**

1. You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/private-internet-access:latest`. See the [wiki](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/wiki/Common-issues#use-a-release-tag) for more information on other tags available.

## Testing

Check the VPN IP address matches your expectations

```sh
docker run --rm --network=container:gluetun alpine:3.12 wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io
```

## Connect to it

There are various ways to achieve this, depending on your use case.

- <details><summary>Connect containers in the same docker-compose.yml as Gluetun</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "service:gluetun"` to your *docker-compose.yml* (no need for `depends_on`)

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect other containers to Gluetun</summary><p>

    Add `--network=container:gluetun` when launching the container, provided Gluetun is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect containers from another docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    Add `network_mode: "container:gluetun"` to your *docker-compose.yml*, provided Gluetun is already running

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in HTTP proxy (i.e. with Chrome, Kodi, etc.)</summary><p>

    ‚ö†Ô∏è You might want to use Shadowsocks instead which tunnels UDP as well as TCP and does not leak your credentials.
    The HTTP proxy will not encrypt your username and password every time you send a request to the HTTP proxy server.

    1. Setup an HTTP proxy client, such as [SwitchyOmega for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en)
    1. Ensure the Gluetun container is launched with:
        - port `8888` published `-p 8888:8888/tcp`
    1. With your HTTP proxy client, connect to the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) on port `8888`. You need to enter your credentials if you set them with `HTTPPROXY_USER` and `HTTPPROXY_PASSWORD`. Note that Chrome does not support authentication.
    1. If you set `HTTPPROXY_LOG` to `on`, more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Connect LAN devices through the built-in *Shadowsocks* proxy (per app, system wide, etc.)</summary><p>

    1. Setup a Shadowsocks proxy client, there is a list of [ShadowSocks clients for **all platforms**](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html)
        - **note** some clients do not tunnel UDP so your DNS queries will be done locally and not through Gluetun and its built in DNS over TLS
        - Clients that support such UDP tunneling are, as far as I know:
            - iOS: Potatso Lite
            - OSX: ShadowsocksX
            - Android: Shadowsocks by Max Lv
    1. Ensure the Gluetun container is launched with:
        - port `8388` published `-p 8388:8388/tcp -p 8388:8388/udp`
    1. With your Shadowsocks proxy client
        - Enter the Docker host (i.e. `192.168.1.10`) as the server IP
        - Enter port TCP (and UDP, if available) `8388` as the server port
        - Use the password you have set with `SHADOWSOCKS_PASSWORD`
        - Choose the encryption method/algorithm to the method you specified in `SHADOWSOCKS_METHOD`
    1. If you set `SHADOWSOCKS_LOG` to `on`, (a lot) more information will be logged in the Docker logs

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to Gluetun</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to Gluetun,
    publish ports `8000` and `9000` for the Gluetun container and access them as you would with any other container

    </p></details>
- <details><summary>Access ports of containers connected to Gluetun, all in the same docker-compose.yml</summary><p>

    In example, to access port `8000` of container `xyz`  and `9000` of container `abc` connected to Gluetun, publish port `8000` and `9000` for the Gluetun container.
    The docker-compose.yml file would look like:

    ```yml
    version: '3.7'
    services:
      gluetun:
        image: qmcgaw/private-internet-access
        container_name: gluetun
        cap_add:
          - NET_ADMIN
        environment:
          - USER=js89ds7
          - PASSWORD=8fd9s239G
        ports:
          - 8000:8000/tcp
          - 9000:9000/tcp
      abc:
        image: abc
        container_name: abc
        network_mode: "service:gluetun"
      xyz:
        image: xyz
        container_name: xyz
        network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    ```

    </p></details>

## Private Internet Access port forwarding

When `PORT_FORWARDING=on`, a port will be forwarded on the VPN server side and written to the file specified by `PORT_FORWARDING_STATUS_FILE=/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port`.
It can be useful to mount this file as a volume to read it from other containers, for example to configure a torrenting client.

For `VPNSP=private internet access` (default), you will keep the same forwarded port for 60 days as long as you bind mount the `/gluetun` directory.

You can also use the HTTP control server (see below) to get the port forwarded.
