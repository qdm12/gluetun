One of the following is required:

- Publicly accessible URL to a zip file containing the Openvpn configuration files
- Publicly accessible URL to a structured (JSON etc.) list of servers **and attach** an example Openvpn configuration file for both TCP and UDP
- Publicly accessible URL to the list of servers **and attach** an example Openvpn configuration file for both TCP and UDP

If the list of servers requires to login **or** is hidden behind an interactive configurator,
it's not possible to support the provider yet.
[The Wiki](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/wiki/Openvpn-file) describes how to use an Openvpn configuration file.
